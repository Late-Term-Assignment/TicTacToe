# About

This is the late term assignment Tic-tac-toe from group Mario lets-ago.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deplay the project on a live system.

## Prerequisites

The backen depends on NodeJS (v8.12.0). 

* [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

## Installing

The first step is to install Node v8.12.0. Follow the link provided above and choose the currect version for your OS.
```

Next you need to clone the repo. Open a terminal and cd into the appropriate directory and enter the following command:

When the repo is up and running you need to install node dependencies
